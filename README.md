# python_assembler  
A significantly better version of my old AQA-assembly-language assembler, written in python.  
Windows downloads are in 'releases', feel free to build for any other platform.  
### USAGE
First, write an assembly program using the syntax uploaded here in instructionSet.txt, then run the program. You will be prompted to choose a file, choose the one you have written and then it will run. You can step through the program with the enter key.

This was written to help with understanding basic assembly concepts, and is in no way an effecient program.
